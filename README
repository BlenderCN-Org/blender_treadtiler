TreadTiler is an addon for Blender 2.5x <http://www.blender.org/> to
allow quick replication of tyre tread patterns: you create a small piece
of the pattern, and TreadTiler will replicate that around a ring to make
the full tyre tread.

The user manual can be found, in HTML format, in the docs/ subdirectory.

Note that Blender 2.5 is still in prerelease and undergoing continuing
development. Its Python APIs are still subject to change, so this script
could very well break at some point. This version has been successfully
tested with Blender 2.55 SVN r32940.
