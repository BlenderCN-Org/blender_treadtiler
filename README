TreadTiler is an addon for Blender 2.61 <http://www.blender.org/> to
allow quick replication of tyre tread patterns: you create a small piece
of the pattern, and TreadTiler will replicate that around a ring to make
the full tyre tread.

The user manual can be found, in HTML format, in the docs/ subdirectory.
Start with docs/index.html.
