<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</DIV>
<P>TreadTiler is an addon for the still-in-development
<A HREF="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</A> 2.5<I>x</I> to
aid in the creation of tyre tread patterns. The basic idea is that you create
a minimal piece of the pattern, and TreadTiler will replicate it around a ring
and join the adjacent sides together to form the complete pattern.


<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Installation"></A>Installation</DIV>
<P>To install TreadTiler, launch Blender 2.5<I>x</I>,  bring up the
User Preferences window, select the Add-Ons tab, and click the “Install Add-Ons”
button. In the file selector dialog that comes up find your way to the directory
containing the <TT>treadtiler.py</TT> file, select it, and click the
“Install Add-On...” button. This will take you back to Blender’s
User Preferences window, where you should find that TreadTiler is now listed among
the available add-ons, which you can enable for the current document by ticking its
checkbox.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Usage"></A>Usage</DIV>
<P>To use TreadTiler, the basic steps are:
<OL>
<LI>Create a mesh that will be replicated to make the tyre-tread pattern
<LI>Add a single unconnected point to the mesh that will serve as the initial centre of rotation
<LI>Select two contiguous lines of vertices along the two opposite sides of the
mesh that will adjoin in successive copies
<LI>Invoke TreadTiler.
<LI>Make any further adjustments necessary to the generated mesh.
</OL>

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="MeshCreation"></A>Creating The Mesh</DIV>
<P>The pattern mesh can consist of pretty much whatever geometry you like. The
main restrictions are:
<UL>
<LI>The two opposite sides that will be joined in adjacent copies
must be <I>parallel</I> and <I>congruent</I>—it must be possible to move one so that
all the vertices line up exactly on top of the other.
<LI>There must be no edges running directly between vertices on those two opposite
sides—there must always be other vertices in-between. Otherwise TreadTiler cannot
separate the selected vertices belonging to the two sides.
</UL>
<P>We will use a simple example to start with. This way, you can be sure have
the basic steps down properly before attempting something more ambitious.
<P>Create a new Grid mesh with 3 subdivisions along
the X-axis and 4 subdivisions along the Y-axis (here in top view):
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh1.png"></DIV>
<P>Select the two middle rows of vertices (parallel to the X-axis) and press <B>S</B>(scale)
then <B>Y</B> to move them symmetrically closer to the edges:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh2.png"></DIV>
<P>Now select the middle column of vertices (parallel to the Y-axis) and move it
along the Y-axis to produce more of a chevron shape:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh3.png"></DIV>
<P>Make sure no vertices are selected. Switch to face-selection mode, and select
the two large rectangular faces:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh4.png"></DIV>
<P>Switch to a more oblique view so you can observe displacement along the Z-axis.
Press the <B>E</B> key to extrude the faces; the extrusion is automatically
constrained to the Z-axis; extrude as much as you want to give some reasonable
depth to the tread pattern:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh5.png"></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="Sidewalls"></A>Making The Sidewalls</DIV>
<P>A tyre is a three-dimensional object. The above steps only define a two-dimensional
surface for the outside of the tyre. To make the tyre three-dimensional, we need to
give it sidewalls.
<P>Make sure nothing is selected. Switch to edge-selection mode, and select the edges
along the two sides that will be parallel to the circumference of the tyre:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh6.png"></DIV>
<P>Extrude these edges parallel to the Z-axis. Then scale the extruded edges along
the X-axis to give a more convex shape to the walls; then extrude again parallel to
the Z-axis, and finally scale back in along the X-axis. The result should look something
like this:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh7.png"></DIV>
<P>Now, you would think you want to join those inner edges, effectively forming a
hollow tube, which TreadTiler would then replicate to form a complete torus.
<I>Don&#8217;t do this</I>. TreadTiler needs to match up corresponding vertices,
and the only way it can do this is by finding the two end vertices in the lines
on each side; joining the vertices up into a complete ring means it can no longer
match them up.
<P>Instead, you can tell TreadTiler to close the ring as part of the process
of generating the complete tyre (see below).

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="RotationCentre"></A>Defining The Initial Centre Of Rotation</DIV>
<P>Now we need to add a single unconnected vertex. This will define the centre
around which the mesh pattern will initially be rotated. Don&#8217;t worry about getting
this absolutely exact&#8212;you can make adjustments to the rotation afterwards.
<P>One way to locate this with respect to the tread pattern is to construct the point
from, say, the four corners of the tread mesh. Make sure nothing is selected, switch
to vertex-selection mode, and select four corners of the tread pattern:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh8.png"></DIV>
<P>Duplicate these vertices (<B>SHIFT+D</B>), constrain their motion to the Z-axis
(press <B>Z</B>) and move them some distance away from the pattern mesh:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh9.png"></DIV>
<P>Then merge them into a single vertex at the centre (<B>ALT+M</B>).
<P><B>Finding the rotation centre:</B> a single unconnected vertex is easy to
lose. If you have trouble seeing where it is (if for example you want to move
it to a different place), first make sure you are in vertex selection mode; right-click
any vertex in the main part of the mesh to select it, then press <B>CTRL+L</B> to
select all vertices linked to that, then <B>CTRL+I</B> to invert the selection. You
should now have just the unconnected vertex selected. If you press <B>CTRL+I</B> and
then <B>CTRL+I</B> again, watch out for the orange dot winking off and on.

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="SelectingSides"></A>Selecting The Sides To Be Joined</DIV>
<P>Make sure no vertices are selected. Now carefully select vertices forming two
contiguous lines on opposite ends of the pattern mesh:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh10.png"></DIV>
<P>If you have TreadTiler properly installed and enabled for this document, then
you should see the TreadTiler panel appear in the Tool Shelf on the left of the 3D view
(probably near the bottom, press <B>T</B> to display the Tool Shelf if it’s not
already visible):
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh11.png"></DIV>
<P>Simply click the “Tile Tread” button to generate the initial mesh:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh12.png"></DIV>
<P>As it appears you should also see the following panel appear at the bottom of the Tool Shelf:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh13.png"></DIV>
<P>If instead you see any error messages about not properly selecting two lines of
vertices, or not having a single unconnected point to be the rotation centre, then
review the steps above and make sure you properly followed them.

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="CompleteTorus"></A>Completing The Torus</DIV>
<P>Check the “Join Ends” box to have TreadTiler complete the torus. You can also
check “Smooth Join” to have smooth shading automatically applied to the faces
created to complete the torus.
<P>Under the label “Rotation Centre Adjust:”, you will see three numbers displayed
that you can adjust. If you hover over these with the mouse, tooltips will appear
explaining what they are:
<OL>
<LI>The radius of rotation, governing the size of the generated mesh. The initial
value of this comes from the distance to the rotation centre vertex that you specified.
<LI>A “tilt” adjustment, which can be used to fine-tune how well adjacent copies
of the tread pattern align together.
<LI>An “asymmetry” adjustment, that can be used to twist the tread pattern towards
one side or the other.
</OL>
<P>The number of copies of the replicated mesh pattern are automatically computed
based on the closest whole-integer number of copies that can be fitted around
the circumference of the rotation around the centre vertex (with the appropriate
scaling adjustment). If you want more copies for a bigger ring, just increase
the rotation radius:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh14.png"></DIV>
<P>Note that the original mesh object you created is not deleted or modified
in any way; instead, a new mesh object is created, taking the name of the old
one and adding “ tread” to the end. Thus, if you followed the above example closely,
the original mesh would have its default name of “Grid”, so the new mesh would
be called “Grid tread”.
<P>Think maybe it looks too angular? Go back to the original mesh pattern, and add
some more vertices in the middle, perhaps by doing a loop cut (<B>CTRL+R</B>):
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh15.png"></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh16.png"></DIV>
<P>Now when you rerun TreadTiler (don’t forget to reselect the vertices along the
two sides to be joined), it will apply a radial displacement to the
extra vertices to give more of a curve to the shape:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="TreadMesh17.png"></DIV>
<P> The effect is quite subtle here, but will be more pronounced if the tyre radius
is made smaller.

<DIV CLASS="h3"><A NAME="AssignMaterials"></A>Assigning Materials</DIV>
<P>You can assign different materials to different parts of the original mesh
(e.g. a different colour for the tread and the sidewalls). These material assignments
will carry over to the corresponding parts of the generated mesh.
